# Cab-fare-prediction-project
The project is about a cab rental company who has its historical data. The objective of the project is to build a model which predicts the fare amount of the Cab rental in the city. This Fare prediction takes in consideration the parameters like distance, No of passengers, date/time and other factors from historical data which was collected from the pilot project for the same. These predicted values would help the business to fix the fare amount for particular number of passengers, peak time or busy days and for particular distance.
